excerpt: We invested a lot of time and coffee into our new website design. Have a look!
---

This is the first redesign of the website ever since we launched the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/license-manager-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**License Manager for WooCommerce**</a> plugin.

For the website we still use <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby.js</a>,
although with a major version upgrade. The site now uses gatsby v3, and we have
switched from using a headless WordPress instance for the content to using
markdown files.

Apart from the obvious design overhaul we have also improved the plugin docs,
which obviously is the most important part and feature of the website. Because
of the switch to Markdown files for content, it is a lot easier to modify the
website content.

If you are missing anything on the website, for example a how-to guide,
information on existing doc pages, please write us at <a href="mailto:support@licensemanager.at">support@licensemanager.at</a>
