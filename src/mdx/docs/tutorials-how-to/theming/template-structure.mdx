License Manager for WooCommerce template files contain the markup and template
structure for frontend and HTML emails of your store.

## How to edit template files

Edit files in an upgrade-safe way using overrides. Copy the template into a
directory within your theme named /woocommerce keeping the same file structure
but removing the /templates/ subdirectory.

Example: To change the **Your license key(s)** heading text in the license
delivery email, copy: `wp-content/plugins/license-manager-for-woocommerce/templates/emails/lmfwc-email-order-license-keys.php`
to `wp-content/themes/yourtheme/woocommerce/emails/emails/lmfwc-email-order-license-keys.php`

The copied file is safe to edit and will now override the default template file.

>Do not edit these files within the core plugin itself as they are
overwritten during the upgrade process and any customizations will be lost.
