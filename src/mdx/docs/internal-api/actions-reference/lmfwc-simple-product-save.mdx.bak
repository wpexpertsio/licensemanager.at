## Description

This action allows you to perform additional action during the **POST**
request which is triggered when saving a simple WooCommerce product.

## Parameters

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`$product_id` | `int` | WooCommerce Product ID

## Usage

```
add_action('lmfwc_simple_product_save', function($product_id) {

  if (isset($_POST['favorite_foo_fighters_song'])) {
    $value = sanitize_text_field(
      $_POST['favorite_foo_fighters_song']
    );

    update_post_meta(
      $product_id,
      'favorite_foo_fighters_song',
