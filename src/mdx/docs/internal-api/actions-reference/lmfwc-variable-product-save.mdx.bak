## Description

This action allows you to perform additional action during the **POST**
request which is triggered when saving a variable WooCommerce product.

## Parameters

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`$variation_id` | `int` | WooCommerce Product Variation ID
`$loop` | `int` | Current variation loop

## Usage

```php
add_action('lmfwc_variable_product_save', function($variation_id) {

  if (isset($_POST['favorite_foo_fighters_song'][$loop])) {
    $value = sanitize_text_field(
      $_POST['favorite_foo_fighters_song'][$loop]
    );

    update_post_meta(
      $variation_id,
      'favorite_foo_fighters_song',
      $value
    );
  }

});
```

This will store the POST field **favorite_foo_fighters_song** into the
Product's post meta.
