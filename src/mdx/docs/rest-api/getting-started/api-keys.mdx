To access the REST API routes, you will first need to create a pair of **API
keys**. These API keys are used to access the REST API routes as a specific
user.

Navigate to the **License Manager** → **Settings** → **REST API keys**. Here
you will be presented with the following screen:

![Overview of REST API keys](/images/docs/rest-api/getting-started/api-keys/overview-of-rest-api-keys.png)
<p className={"image-desc"}>Overview of REST API keys</p>

On this screen, press the “**Add key**” button at the top of the page. From
here on, you will be redirected to the following form:

![“Create REST API keys” form](/images/docs/rest-api/getting-started/api-keys/creating-rest-api-keys.png)
<p className={"image-desc"}>“Create REST API keys” form</p>

All fields are required. The “**Description**” field provides a name for this
REST API key pair, which should summarize what it is the keys are being used
for. The “User” field is a searchable dropdown field which determines to whom
these keys will be assigned to. The “Permissions” field grants the REST API
keys either read, write, or read/write permissions.

After filling out the form and pressing the “**Generate API key**” button, you
will be redirected to the following page:

![REST API keys have been created](/images/docs/rest-api/getting-started/api-keys/rest-api-key.png)
<p className={"image-desc"}>REST API keys have been created</p>

As the success message instructs, you should now **store these keys somewhere
safe**, as this is the last time you will see the secret key. If you do not
save the REST API keys, or lose them, you will not be able to recover them.
Because the consumer secret is stored as a hash inside the database, it is
impossible to revert. Should this occur, you will need to generate a pair of
new REST API keys.
