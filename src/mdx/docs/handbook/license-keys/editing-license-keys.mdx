It is possible to edit any and all license keys, even the ones already delivered to customers – so be careful! First,
navigate to the **License Manager** → **License keys** page and find the license key you wish to edit. Afterwards,
hover and click the „Edit” action link as shown below.

By clicking the action link you will be redirected to a new page, containing the form with the data of the license key
as it currently is. Make your changes and click the „**Save**“ button.
