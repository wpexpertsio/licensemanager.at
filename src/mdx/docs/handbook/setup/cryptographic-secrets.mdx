The plugin stores all license keys in an encrypted fashion inside the database. During activation the plugin will
create the following directory.

`wp-content/uploads/lmfwc-files`

Inside this directory, the plugin creates two files (defuse.txt and secret.txt). The contents of these files are used
to encrypt, decrypt, and hash all license keys.

>Before doing anything else, please create a backup of these two files and store them somewhere safe. If anything
happens, and these files are deleted or overwritten, **you will permanently lose all license keys** stored in your
database!
