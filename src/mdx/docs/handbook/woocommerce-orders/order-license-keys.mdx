If a **WooCommerce order** contains licensed products, then the corresponding
license keys will be used/generated once the order status is set to
“Completed”. These license keys will then be visibly marked as sold/delivered
in the license key overview, and inside their corresponding orders. An example
of this is shown below; an order which contains two licensed products.
